# Predicting Real Estate Prices with AI Linear Regression Algorithm

In this project, using the Linear Regression Algorithm, the issue of making price predictions using information about a newly added house according to the data set was examined.

#### Example of data used:

#### When new data is added:

For example,

When a house with an area of 275, number of rooms is 3, and building age is 11 is added...
